Pig Game README


Welcome to the magical game of Pig.

- Player1 (the Human player) starts off the game by pressing "y" to roll.

- If a roll greater than 1 is earned Player1 accumulates points equal to value rolled.

- Player1 must then decide whether to continue with "y" or pass/hold with "n".

- However, if roll == 1 is rolled, Player1 loses all points earned this turn and pass off the turn to Player2 (the Computer player).

- Player2 continues process above; Player2 will always halt turn and pass when score of 20 is attained in a single turn.

- Process continues until score of 100 or greater is reached by Player1 or Player2.

- The first Player to reach score >= 100 is declared the winner.
